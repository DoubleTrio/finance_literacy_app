        <b>Roth vs. Traditional Plans:</b>
        For each type of retirement plan like 401(k)s and IRAs, there’s typically two options provided usually Traditional or Roth options. For 401(k)s and 403(b)s, Traditional 401(k)s are usually referred as just a 401(k) and the same for 403(b)s…
        <p style= "margin-left: 50px;">
         <b>Roth:</b>
          This type of retirement account is usually the most preferred type whenever available, because of its tax advantages. This type of account usually gives a tax advantage over a traditional retirement savings account, since all contributions are already taxed before hand and any withdrawals are tax-free since the contribution was already taxed before. Therefore, you can accumulate a sizable nest egg and not pay additional taxes on your investments! However, for Roth IRAs, they are only available to contribute to within certain income limits set by the IRS (*It is worth noting there is a strategy to avoid these income limits called Backdoor Roth IRAs, which is explained 
          <a href="https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/article/how-to-set-up-backdoor-ira"> here</a>.
         <br></br>
         <b>Traditional:</b>
         For these accounts, contributions are not taxed before depositing them into the account, since taxes will be taken out upon withdrawing money out of the account. These accounts are always available by most employers, and if there is no option to add a Roth 401(k) or 403(b) plan, they are still a good option to invest in. 
        </p>
        <p style= "margin-left: 25px;">
          It is worth noting that these two plans are not mutually exclusive, and you can have a Roth account and a Traditional account, and contribute up to the yearly limits for both.

        <b>401(k) and 403(b) Plans:</b>
         These plans typically are provided by your employer, and starting in the beginning of the year 2025, new employees will be automatically enrolled into these plans by their employers because of

         Therefore, this part is not really much of a worry for new graduates as compared to before!
        <br></br>
        For 401(k) and 403(b) Plans, it’s important to look at the employer matching contribution and try to at least match it, typically this is about 6% of your income and employers match from 50¢ to $1 per dollar contributed into the plan. Therefore, you get additional value from 9% to 12% of your total income!

      <p style= "margin-left: 25px;">
        <b>IRA Plans:</b>
         Compared with 401(k) and 403(b) plans, IRA plans are more of an individual retirement option. There are however different options for IRAs, usually called “self-directed investing” where you can control what investments you would like to contribute to, or you can have a company pick the investments for you based on your risk tolerance (essentially how much risk you are willing to take on losses based on stock market performance). IRAs also have an additional type of account called a Rollover IRA, which is primarily used to either create a Backdoor Roth IRA like mentioned earlier, or to transfer an old 401(k) or 403(b) plan, which typically happens when changing employers.

        <b>Early Withdrawals:</b>
        Depending on your financial situation, you may have to tap into your retirement savings as a last resort. For cases of extreme emergency, it is possible to get an exception to the tax consequences of withdrawing early because of the SECURE 2.0 act, specifically for major disasters, victims of domestic abuse, personal emergencies, or terminal illness. Otherwise, before the age of 59 1/2, early withdrawals usually incur a tax liability (essentially owing more taxes on top of the withdrawn amount).

        <b>Early Retirement: </b>
       There are also financial movements such as 
       <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-independence-retire-early-fire.asp">F.I.R.E (Financial Independence Retire Early)</a>
       
      .Proponents of this method advocate for retiring early through a number called an FIRE number or commonly a FU (yes, that...) number, which is the amount of money needed to sustain typical expenses during a early retirement period.
       
       
       One of the ways that people using the FIRE strategy achieve this is through a 
       <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/how-roth-conversion-ladder-works-5214808">Roth Conversion Ladder</a>. This method allows you to contribute to an IRA and withdrawal early through rolling over Traditional IRA funds to a Roth IRA, so that there is a grace period to withdraw and basically “collect” an “income” from your IRAs.
