# InvestED

Submission for Lehigh Valley 24-hour hackathon.

In this project, we created a mini interactive financial course using HTML, SASS, Bootstrap, Flask, and Jinja. Our motivation was that college students, which included the majority of us in the group weren't too financially literate. Some topics that we covered included preparing for your first job, basic tax information, credit cards, student loans, and more. 


# Run Project Locally

- Run `npm install`

# Challenges

- We initially started out with trying to development a mobile app using Flutter. However, setting up the development environment proved troublesome for everyone. The first couple of hours was burnt quickly and we found little to no success in setting up the environment for Flutter
- None of us had experience in Flask and had beginner web development experience, all of which took a long time to get comfortable
- We had trouble deploying our Flask application following this [tutorial](https://aws.amazon.com/tutorials/serve-a-flask-app/)
